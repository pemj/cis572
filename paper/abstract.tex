In this paper, we consider the problem of automatic forest coverage 
classification.  Given a collection of cartographic variables, we wish 
to construct a model capable of reliably predicting the predominant 
type of tree cover 

The motivation for this is going to be tricky.  Why do we care about 
forest cover type?  why does anybody?  the forest service seems to care, 
and I suppose bio folks might have a vested interest in the whole 
procedure.  there are correlations between these elements.  a big part 
of this will be examining those correlations.

So,the issue is that
