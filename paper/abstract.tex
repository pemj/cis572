\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we consider the problem of automatic forest coverage 
classification, as posed by the Kaggle competition: 
``Forest Cover Type Prediction.''  In short, we use python's machine 
learning libraries to construct a model capable of reliably predicting 
the predominant type of tree cover for a small region of forest, given 
a collection of cartographic variables. We create such a model by 
leveraging a voting body of a number of different classifiers, with a 
second layer of classifiers for certain cases.  We optimize this 
technique by carrying out a number of feature transformations and 
subsequent feature scaling operations, making use of a number of 
statistical relationships discovered through judicious application of 
graphical data analysis tools.

We find that the classifier thus developed is capable of reliably 
predicting accurate forest cover with approximately 80\% accuracy.  In 
reviewing the particulars of the performance of our algorithms, we 
gain some insight into the data set, and the problem domain in general.\\
