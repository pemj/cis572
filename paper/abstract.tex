problem, motivation, solution, takeaway

In this paper, we consider the problem of automatic forest coverage 
classification, as posed by the Kaggle competition: 
``Forest Cover Type Prediction.''  In short, we wish to construct a 
model capable of reliably predicting the predominant type of tree 
cover for a small region of forest, given a collection of cartographic 
variables. We create such a model by leveraging a voting body of a 
numnber of different classifiers.  We supplement this technique by 
carrying out a number of feature transformations and subsequent feature 
scaling, making use of a number of statistical relationships discovered 
through judicious use of graphical data analysis.

After carrying out such modifications to the feature set, our ensemble 
classifer could dependably reach 80\% accuracy.  The structure of our 
classification setup implies is such that we gain some insight into a 
the data set, and the problem domain in general.\\
