\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:-intro}

It is popular to model education as a process of ever-increasing 
specialization.  Preschool acclimatizes larval humans to basic 
scholarly etiquette (listening, sharing, naptime)), while Kindergarten 
begins a focus on more distinct and practical skills such as reading, 
writing, and simple arithmetic.  high-school allows one to select a few 
electives, and the undergraduate degree program finally allows for the 
selection of the glorious Major.  By the time one has reached the PhD 
program, one's course of study has narrowed down to a mere fraction of 
the breadth of earlier, sometimes a single problem.

It is no surprise that interdisciplinary research has become one of the 
hottest buzzwords in modern educational policy.  It serves as a way to 
reintroduce breadth of experience to a collection of fields that are 
sorely lacking in that regard.
