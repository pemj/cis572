\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:-conc}

In this paper, we examine a number of machine learning algorithms as 
they apply to the problem of classifying forest cover based on 
cartographic variables.  We specify accuracy both for naive solutions 
(before tuning), and for solutions with more carefully tuned 
hyperparameters.  The final collection of k-Nearest Neighbor, Support 
Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting Machine, and Random Forest result in 
a significant increase in accuracy over the next best approach, at a 
final accuracy of 80\%. Combining outputs from different algorithms
was helpful for our final result, in future projects we would like
to develop a better randomizer for generating validation data from
the given training data to minimize overfitting.
